//How would you go about computing the parity of a very large number of 64-bit nonnegative integers?

/*
Certainly! The code you've presented is an algorithm to compute the parity of a 64-bit integer. Parity, in this context, is 1 if the number of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of the integer is odd, and 0 if it is even. This particular implementation is an optimization that reduces the size of the required lookup table by using the property that parity is commutative.

Let's break down the algorithm step by step:

The input to the function parity4 is a 64-bit unsigned integer x.

The algorithm first reduces the 64-bit integer to a 32-bit integer by XORing the top 32 bits with the bottom 32 bits. The parity of the resulting 32-bit integer is the same as the parity of the original 64-bit integer.


x ^= x >> 32;
Next, the algorithm progressively halves the number of bits being considered by doing shifts and XORs. Each step maintains the parity of the integer:


x ^= x >> 16; // Reduces to 16 bits
x ^= x >> 8;  // Reduces to 8 bits
x ^= x >> 4;  // Reduces to 4 bits
After these steps, the 64-bit integer's parity is now contained within the last four bits of x. The algorithm masks out any bits higher than the 4th bit to ensure that only these 4 bits are considered:


x &= 0xf; // only want the last 4 bits of x.
The last four bits are then used to index into a precomputed lookup table that contains the parity for all 4-bit numbers:


return four_bit_parity_lookup(x) & 1;
The lookup table kFourBitParityLookupTable is a 16-bit integer with the binary representation 0b0110100110010110. Each bit in this table represents the parity of the 4-bit integer corresponding to its position. For example, the least significant bit represents the parity of 0b0000, the next bit represents the parity of 0b0001, and so on.

The four_bit_parity_lookup function takes the last four bits from x and shifts the lookup table right by that amount, effectively selecting the bit that corresponds to the parity of the 4-bit value of x. The least significant bit of the result is the parity of the original 64-bit integer.


return kFourBitParityLookupTable >> x;
The & 1 operation in parity4 and four_bit_parity_lookup ensures that only the least significant bit is returned, which represents the parity of the input integer.

The beauty of this algorithm is its efficiency. Instead of checking every bit of the 64-bit integer, it uses bitwise operations to quickly reduce the problem to a simple 4-bit lookup, which is very fast on modern processors.

#######################################


Sure! Let's walk through an example using the parity4 function with a hypothetical 64-bit unsigned integer. Suppose our 64-bit integer is 0b1011001110001111000011110000111100001111000011110000111100001111, which we'll call x. Let's compute its parity:

XOR the top 32 bits with the bottom 32 bits:

   10110011100011110000111100001111 (x's top 32 bits)
XOR
   00001111000011110000111100001111 (x's bottom 32 bits)
-----------------------------------
   10111100100000000000100000000000 (resulting 32-bit integer)
So now x is equal to 0b10111100100000000000100000000000.

Perform the XOR operations with right shifts by 16, 8, and 4 bits:

x ^= x >> 16; // Shift right by 16 bits and XOR:
   10111100100000000000100000000000
XOR
   00000000101111001000000000001000
-----------------------------------
   10111100001111001000100000001000

x ^= x >> 8; // Shift right by 8 bits and XOR:
   10111100001111001000100000001000
XOR
   00000000101111000011110010001000
-----------------------------------
   10111100110000001011010010000000

x ^= x >> 4; // Shift right by 4 bits and XOR:
   10111100110000001011010010000000
XOR
   00001011110011000000101101001000
-----------------------------------
   10110111000011001011111111001000
After these operations, x is 0b10110111000011001011111111001000.

Mask out all but the last four bits:

x &= 0xf; // Mask with 0xf to get the last four bits:
   10110111000011001011111111001000
AND
   00000000000000000000000000001111
-----------------------------------
   00000000000000000000000000001000
Now x is 0b1000, which is 8 in decimal.

Use the last four bits (0b1000) to look up the parity in the kFourBitParityLookupTable:

const int kFourBitParityLookupTable = 0x6996; // 0b0110100110010110

// Shift the lookup table right by the value of 'x' (which is 8):
return kFourBitParityLookupTable >> 8;
Shifting the binary representation of kFourBitParityLookupTable (0b0110100110010110) to the right by 8 positions, we get 0b01101001.

Finally, we return the least significant bit of the result, which represents the parity:

0b01101001
AND
0b00000001
---------
0b00000001
The least significant bit is 1, meaning the parity of our original 64-bit integer is odd.

Why does this algorithm work?

The key insight is that XOR is associative and commutative, meaning that the order in which bits are XORed does not affect the final result, and XORing a number with itself results in 0. Since we're interested in parity, which is a count of the number of 1 bits modulo 2, each pair of bits that are the same effectively cancel out when XORed. Thus, we can XOR large chunks of the number together and still retain the correct parity information. By repeatedly halving the number of bits we're considering with XORs and shifts, we quickly reduce the problem to a 4-bit number whose parity can be looked up in a small table. This is much faster than checking each bit individually.

############################################


The purpose of XORing the upper 32 bits with the lower 32 bits of a 64-bit integer is to reduce the problem of finding the parity of 64 bits to finding the parity of 32 bits.

Here's why XORing the upper 32 bits with the lower 32 bits works for computing parity:

Parity Property: Parity is the count of bits set to 1, taken modulo 2. The XOR operation itself is a parity function; XOR of two bits will be 1 if the number of bits set to 1 is odd (i.e., the parities are different), and 0 if the number of bits set to 1 is even (i.e., the parities are the same).

Associative and Commutative: XOR is both associative ((a XOR b) XOR c == a XOR (b XOR c)) and commutative (a XOR b == b XOR a). This means that the order in which we combine bits or groups of bits does not affect the final outcome of the parity calculation.

Combining Parities: If you take two groups of bits and XOR their parities, the result will be the parity of the combined group. This is because if both groups have even parity, their combination also has even parity; if one has even and the other has odd parity, the combination has odd parity.

By applying XOR to the upper 32 bits and the lower 32 bits, we're effectively combining the parity of two halves of the 64-bit integer. The result is a 32-bit integer that contains the combined parity information of the original 64-bit integer. Here's how it works:

If both halves have even parity, the result will have even parity (0 XOR 0 = 0).
If one half has even parity and the other has odd parity, the result will have odd parity (0 XOR 1 = 1 or 1 XOR 0 = 1).
If both halves have odd parity, the result will have even parity (1 XOR 1 = 0).
By doing this, we've reduced the problem from 64 bits to 32 bits without losing any information about the overall parity. We then continue this process by XORing and shifting to reduce the 32-bit integer down to 16, 8, and finally 4 bits, at which point we can use a simple lookup table to find the parity.

The main reason we don't XOR the whole 64-bit integer with the upper 32 bits is because we want to reduce the size of the data we're working with. If we did XOR the whole 64-bit integer with the upper 32 bits, we'd still have a 64-bit result, which doesn't help us in reducing the problem size. The goal is to get to a smaller bit size that can be handled efficiently with a lookup table.



############################################


I see where the confusion might be stemming from. When we say "XOR the upper 32 bits with the lower 32 bits," it's a shorthand for the following operation:

You take the original 64-bit integer x and shift it right by 32 bits, which effectively isolates the upper 32 bits and moves them into the position of the lower 32 bits. Then you XOR this shifted value with the original 64-bit integer x. The operation does not change the upper 32 bits of x because the shifted value has zeroes in the upper 32 bits. Here's a visual explanation using a 64-bit integer x:


Original x:    1111000011110000111100001111000011110000111100001111000011110000
x >> 32:       0000000000000000000000000000000011110000111100001111000011110000
               --------------------------------------------------------------
XOR result:    1111000011110000111100001111000000000000000000000000000000000000
So the operation is effectively XORing the upper 32 bits with the lower 32 bits of x, but in practice, you perform x ^= x >> 32; to combine the parity of the upper and lower halves of x into the lower 32 bits of x.

After this operation, the upper 32 bits of x are no longer needed for the parity calculation because their information has been combined with the lower 32 bits. The subsequent operations will only consider the lower 32 bits (which now contain the parity information of the entire 64-bit integer), and they will further reduce this to 16 bits, then to 8 bits, and finally to 4 bits to use with the lookup table.

The kFourBitParityLookupTable is used to quickly determine the parity of a 4-bit number without performing individual bit checks. This is an optimization technique that takes advantage of precomputed results to enhance the performance of the algorithm, particularly when dealing with a large number of parity calculations.

Here's why the lookup table is useful:

Efficiency: Computing the parity by iterating over each bit and counting the number of 1s can be time-consuming, especially when the operation needs to be performed many times or on large datasets. A lookup table provides the result in constant time, regardless of the number of bits.

Simplicity: Once you've reduced the problem to 4 bits, using a lookup table simplifies the code and avoids the need for further bitwise operations. This can make the code shorter and potentially easier to understand and maintain.

Precomputed Values: The parity of every 4-bit number can be precomputed and stored in a table since there are only 16 possible 4-bit numbers (from 0 to 15). The kFourBitParityLookupTable contains these precomputed parity values for all 4-bit numbers.

Direct Access: Using the 4-bit value as an index, you can directly access the corresponding precomputed parity value in the table. This is much faster than computing the parity from scratch.

The kFourBitParityLookupTable is a 16-bit integer where each bit represents the parity of the corresponding 4-bit number. In binary, it looks like this: 0b0110100110010110. Here's how the bits correspond to the 4-bit numbers (0 to 15):


Index (decimal)  Index (binary)  Parity  Table bit
0                0000            0       0
1                0001            1       1
2                0010            1       1
3                0011            0       0
4                0100            1       1
5                0101            0       0
6                0110            0       0
7                0111            1       1
8                1000            1       1
9                1001            0       0
10               1010            0       0
11               1011            1       1
12               1100            0       0
13               1101            1       1
14               1110            1       1
15               1111            0       0
To use the table, you simply shift the table to the right by the number represented by the 4-bit value and then look at the least significant bit (LSB) of the result. The LSB will be the precomputed parity value for that 4-bit number.

In summary, the kFourBitParityLookupTable allows for a fast and efficient way to determine the parity of a 4-bit number, which is the final step in the parity calculation algorithm for a 64-bit integer after reducing it down to 4 bits through XOR and shift operations.

The kFourBitParityLookupTable works by storing the precomputed parity of all 4-bit numbers in a compact form. Each bit in the lookup table represents the parity of the corresponding 4-bit binary number. Because there are only 16 possible combinations of 4-bit numbers (from 0 to 15), a 16-bit integer can be used to store the parity of each.

Here's how the kFourBitParityLookupTable is structured, assuming it is defined as const int kFourBitParityLookupTable = 0x6996; which in binary is 0b0110100110010110:


Binary Index (represents a 4-bit number):  0000 0001 0010 0011 0100 0101 0110 0111 1000 1001 1010 1011 1100 1101 1110 1111
Parity (1 for odd, 0 for even):            0    1    1    0    1    0    0    1    1    0    0    1    0    1    1    0
Each bit in kFourBitParityLookupTable corresponds to the parity of the 4-bit binary index above it. The rightmost bit (least significant bit) corresponds to the parity of 0000, the next bit to the left corresponds to the parity of 0001, and so on up to the leftmost bit (most significant bit) which corresponds to the parity of 1111.

When you want to find the parity of a 4-bit number using this table, you follow these steps:

Reduce the original 64-bit number through a series of XORs and shifts until you have a 4-bit value (as described in the algorithm provided earlier).

Use the resulting 4-bit value as an index to look up the parity in the kFourBitParityLookupTable. You do this by shifting the table to the right by the index value, which effectively moves the bit representing the parity of that index into the least significant bit position.

Mask the shifted value with 1 (by using & 1) to isolate the least significant bit, which is the parity for your original 4-bit index.

For example, if your 4-bit value is 1010 (which is 10 in decimal), you would shift the kFourBitParityLookupTable right by 10 positions:


kFourBitParityLookupTable = 0b0110100110010110
Shift right by 10:          0b0000000001101001
Now, you would take the least significant bit of the result to get the parity:


Shifted table: 0b0000000001101001
Mask with 1:   0b0000000000000001 (using & 1)
Result:        0b1
The result is 1, which tells you that the parity of the 4-bit number 1010 is odd. This process can be done very quickly by a computer, making it an efficient way to calculate parity.

The prefix 0x indicates that the number following it is in hexadecimal (base 16) notation. Hexadecimal is a base-16 number system that uses sixteen distinct symbols, typically the numbers from 0 to 9 to represent values zero to nine, and the letters A to F (or a to f) to represent values ten to fifteen.

In the case of 0x6996, each digit represents a value in base 16:

The first digit 6 is in the 16^3 (4096) place.
The second digit 9 is in the 16^2 (256) place.
The third digit 9 is in the 16^1 (16) place.
The fourth digit 6 is in the 16^0 (1) place.
Calculating the value in decimal (base 10), you would get:


6 * 16^3 + 9 * 16^2 + 9 * 16^1 + 6 * 16^0
= 6 * 4096 + 9 * 256 + 9 * 16 + 6 * 1
= 24576 + 2304 + 144 + 6
= 27030
So, 0x6996 in hexadecimal is 27030 in decimal.


################################################

The kFourBitParityLookupTable is shifted by the 4-bit value obtained from the previous XOR and shift operations in order to retrieve the precomputed parity for that specific 4-bit value.

Here's the reasoning behind this:

Indexing: In the kFourBitParityLookupTable, each bit position corresponds to the parity of a 4-bit integer. The table is designed so that if you want to find the parity of the 4-bit value n, you look at the bit in the n-th position of the table.

Retrieving the Parity: To access the n-th bit in the table, you can shift the table to the right by n positions. This moves the bit at the n-th position to the least significant bit (LSB) position. Once the desired bit is in the LSB position, you can use a bitwise AND operation with 1 to isolate that bit and read off the parity.

Efficiency: This method allows you to use the 4-bit value directly as an index without having to write a series of if-else statements or a switch-case block. It's a very efficient way to retrieve information from a small lookup table because bitwise shift and AND operations are very fast in hardware.

For example, if your 4-bit value is 1010 (which is 10 in decimal), you want to retrieve the 10th bit from the kFourBitParityLookupTable. You shift the table to the right by 10 positions, moving the 10th bit to the LSB position. Then, by performing a bitwise AND with 1, you isolate that LSB, which now contains the parity for the original 4-bit value 1010.

Here's the code that performs this operation:


short four_bit_parity_lookup (int x) {
    return (kFourBitParityLookupTable >> x) & 1;
}
In this function, x is the 4-bit index, kFourBitParityLookupTable is shifted right by x positions, and the result is masked with 1 to return only the LSB, which represents the parity of the 4-bit number.


##############################################


Let's go through an example to demonstrate how the lookup table works for finding the parity of a 4-bit value using kFourBitParityLookupTable.

Suppose we have the 4-bit value 1010. We want to find its parity (whether it has an odd or even number of 1s). The binary 1010 is equivalent to the decimal number 10. We will use this decimal number to index into our lookup table.

The kFourBitParityLookupTable is defined as 0x6996, which in binary is 0b0110100110010110. This 16-bit binary number is our lookup table, where each bit represents the parity of the corresponding 4-bit number. For clarity, let's write out the table with indices:


Index:   0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9    10   11   12   13   14   15
Binary: 0000 0001 0010 0011 0100 0101 0110 0111 1000 1001 1010 1011 1100 1101 1110 1111
Table:  0b0110100110010110
In the table, the bit at index 10 (counting from the right, starting with index 0) represents the parity of the binary number 1010.

To find this bit, we use the following steps:

Shift the Table: We shift the lookup table to the right by the decimal index of our 4-bit value. Since our 4-bit value is 1010 (decimal 10), we shift the table right by 10 bits.

kFourBitParityLookupTable >> 10:
0b0110100110010110 (binary representation of 0x6996)
>> 10 (shift right by 10)
--------------------------------
0b0000000001101001 (resulting value after the shift)
Isolate the LSB: We're interested in the least significant bit (LSB) of this shifted value because it represents the parity of 1010. To isolate the LSB, we perform a bitwise AND with 1:

0b0000000001101001 (resulting value after the shift)
& 0b0000000000000001 (binary representation of 1)
--------------------------------
0b0000000000000001 (LSB, which gives us the parity)
The LSB of the result is 1, indicating an odd parity for the 4-bit value 1010.

In summary, by shifting the kFourBitParityLookupTable right by the value of our 4-bit number (10 in this case) and then looking at the LSB of the result, we find that the parity of 1010 is odd.

This approach is efficient because it eliminates the need for multiple conditional checks or a loop to count the number of 1s in the 4-bit value. Instead, it uses a precomputed table and a couple of fast bitwise operations to get the result.
